You know more today than you did yesterday.
Your code gets better every day.
You'll get there, keep trying.
You are working your ass off! High five for that.
Stop comparing yourself--you're great.
Take a breath, take a break.
There is more to life than code. But for now, learn what you can.
You're getting back as much as your putting in. Remember that.
Look around you! Aren't these people great?
"If you keep putting bricks on top of each other, it might take a long time but eventually youâ€™ll have a wall."
Remember when you didn't know what a hash was? You've come so far!
Enjoy these moments.
Celebrate the success of others. It will help you not go crazy.
Everyone has bugs... You are not alone!!!
You solved your bug?!?? THAT'S AMAZING!
Celebrate the little successes. Honestly, they are important!
You're building something. Now that's exciting.
